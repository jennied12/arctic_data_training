```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

To access 'filter' from the 'stats' package:
'stats::filter()'

# Read in and clean up data

```{r}
catch_original <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method = "libcurl"),
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(catch_original)
```



Select the columns we want using 'select()'

```{r}
catch_data <- catch_original %>% 
 # select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum)
select(-All, -notesRegCode)

head(catch_data)
```

```{r}
summary(catch_data)
```

Change values in the Chinook column to numeric using 'mutate()'

```{r}
catch_clean <- catch_data %>% 
  mutate(Chinook = as.numeric(Chinook))

head(catch_clean)
```

investigat NA error using 'which()' and 'is.na()'

```{r}
i <- which(is.na(catch_clean$Chinook))
i
```

401 represents the number of the row that has a 'NA'

```{r}
catch_original[i,]
```

*use 'mutate' to change the I to a 1
*use 'mutate' to coerce Chinook column to numeric

```{r}
catch_clean <-catch_data %>% 
  mutate(Chinook = ifelse(Chinook %in% c("I", "l"), 1, Chinook)) %>% 
  mutate (Chinook = as.numeric(Chinook))

head(catch_clean)
```


# Tidy

Move from wide format to tall format using 'pivot_longer()'

```{r}
catch_long <- catch_clean %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(Region, Year), 
  names_to = "species", values_to = "catch")
  
head(catch_long)
```

```{r}
catch_wide <- catch_long %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = species, values_from = catch)

head(catch_wide)
```

'rename()' catch to catch_thousands
'mutate ()' to create new catch column

```{r}
catch_long <- catch_long %>% 
  rename(catch_thousands = catch) %>% 
  mutate(catch = catch_thousands * 1000) %>% 
  select(-catch_thousands)

head(catch_long)
```

mean catch by region

```{r}
mean_region <-catch_long %>% 
  group_by(Region) %>% 
  summarise(mean_catch = mean(catch))

mean_region
```

# Summarize

# Join Region Code

```{r}
region_defs <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.303.1",
                            method = "libcurl"),
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% 
    select(code, mgmtArea)

head(region_defs)
```

```{r}
catch_joined <- left_join(catch_long, region_defs, by = c("Region" = "code"))

head(catch_joined)
```

```{r}
region_defs <- region_defs %>% 
  rename(Region = code, Region_Name = mgmtArea)

catch_joined <- left_join(catch_long, region_defs, by = c("Region"))

head(catch_joined)
```

# Seperate and Unite Example

```{r}
dates_df <- data.frame(date = c("5/24/1930",
                                "5/25/1930",
                                "5/26/1930",
                                "5/27/1930",
                                "5/28/1930"),
                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

dates_df %>% 
  separate(date, c("month", "day", "year"), "/", remove = FALSE) 
```
```{r}
dates_df %>% 
  separate(date, c("month", "day", "year"), "/", remove = FALSE) %>% 
  unite(date_2, year, month, day, sep = "-")
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
